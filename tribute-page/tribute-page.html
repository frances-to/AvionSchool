                <li class = "events"><b>1945 - </b>Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                <li class = "events"><b>1953 - </b>Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>

Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <li class = "events"><b>2009 - </b>Dies at the age of 95.</li>
